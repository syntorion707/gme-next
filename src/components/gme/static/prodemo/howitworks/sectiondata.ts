Our system was designed to adapt, change, and conform to your company, easily putting you in control to customize your GME PRO site to the unique way you do business.',
        p2: 'With nearly 30 different permission features you can completely customize your team’s accounts and their capabilities with the click of a button. Looking for a way to require purchasers to get approval for orders? PRO has a permission setting for that! How about limiting purchases to a select list of items that you have approved? Or what about creating users that can only access accounting related functions like reporting and bill pay? PRO has permissions for that, too.',
        p3: 'The possibilities are truly endless – and the best part? You can make it work in a way that is most efficient for you. Permission templates add another layer of convenience to the PRO platform. With our easy to implement permission templates, you can empower your employees based on common role-based permissions like Admins, Accounting, Order Approvers, or Order Requesters.',
        p4: 'Need to create new users? You’ve got the power to do that, too – simply use one of our permission templates or select customized user permissions. Our powerful user management tools give you complete control over which team members have access to what and when. Activating or deactivating users is immediate, putting you in control to act quickly as your business grows.',

        p1: 'Analyzing the money your company is spending can significantly impact your business. GME PRO’s robust reporting system provides a wide variety of reporting tools to help you make the best decisions for your business. Reports are easily generated and customizable. Download them as an Excel document, a CSV file, or a PDF with the click of a button.',
        p2: 'Our PRO reporting system allows you to save time on tracking down receipts, invoices, POs, and more and houses all your reports in one location within your management dashboard. Find out what money is being spent (company-wide), who is placing the orders, where the products are going, when they are being ordered, and so much more. Take your reports to the next level with an intuitive filtering system that provides the customization to track down the information you need. Need to know how much a specific employee spent in a specific category? Our filters can help you quickly track down that information.',
        p3: 'Reporting is never done – or so it would seem. But that doesn’t mean we can’t make it easier, right? With GME PRO you can take control of your reports by scheduling recurring reports so they come to you automatically. Simply select the report, the time period, the format, and when you want the report to be generated, and you’ll receive it on the schedule you’ve selected. Want to get a monthly report of all purchases by shipping location? No problem. How about seeing what each buyer purchased the week before? You can do that as well.',
